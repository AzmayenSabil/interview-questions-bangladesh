### Intro
Chaldal interview process has 3 stage

1. Apltitude Test: Basic reasoning, vocabulary, maths etc
2. First round Interview :  There will be 2 seperate interview. The questions asked depend on the interviewer. They may be coding or technical or both. Two yes will lead to next round. 1 yes and 1 no gives you a third chance.
3. CTO round: It is kind of a behavioural round. But the questions can be coding or technical.

In the game of life, you have a 2D matrix of small squares that can be either alive or dead. The matrix goes through iterations, and on every iteration the squares can die or be revived. This is based on the previous iteration and the below rules
A living square with 1 or less neighbors in the previous iteration will die, as if from loneliness
A living square with 2 or 3 neighbors in the previous iteration will survive, as if from contentment
A living square with 4 or more neighbors in the previous iteration will die, as if from overpopulation
A dead square with exactly 3 neighbors in the previous iteration will be revived, as if by unfulfilled desires
Implement a square matrix of size 20 and set up the initial five (given) living squares. Then run 10 iterations on it, then print the final matrix. 0,0 should be the top left of the matrix, where the first is the row and the second is the column.
matrix size = 20
iterations = 10
initial squares =
[0][0]
[1][1]

Approach:
Counting Frequencies: Use a hash map (unordered_map) to count the frequency of each element in the array.

Custom Comparator: Define a custom comparator function to sort elements:

Compare elements first by their frequency (higher frequency first).
If two elements have the same frequency, compare their first appearance order in the original array.
Sorting: Utilize the std::sort function from the <algorithm> library with the custom comparator.

Implementation: Iterate through the array, count frequencies, and then sort using the defined custom comparator.

Mr. Kim has to deliver refrigerators to N customers. From the office, he is going to visit all the customers and then return to his home. 
Each location of the office, his home, and the customers is given in the form of integer coordinates (x,y) (0≤x≤100, 0≤y≤100) . 
The distance between two arbitrary locations (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is computed by |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|, where |x| denotes the absolute value 
of x; for instance, |3|=|-3|=3. The locations of the office, his home, and the customers are all distinct. You should plan an optimal way 
to visit all the N customers and return to his among all the possibilities.
You are given the locations of the office, Mr. Kim’s home, and the customers; the number of the customers is in the range of 5 to 10. 
Write a program that, starting at the office, finds a (the) shortest path visiting all the customers and returning to his home.

Given 5 element. We want to search million time that will return if the searched element is present or no. What is the best time complexity.
</summary>
<br>
[Answer]
To sort  $nlog(n)$. Then for each time search $log(n)$.

(Note from Tamim: It might be better to use linear search. The internal mechanism for binary search has some constant overhead. For small number that overhead overshadows the benefit of logarithmic complexity. I ran both linear search and binary search. Linear search is about 5 times faster than binary search)

You have string with repeated character. Example : `abcaade`. Count the number of characters that occur more than once. You can’t use array or map. 
</summary>
<br>
[Answer 1]
My approach : Sort & search concurrent character `nlog(n)`.  

[Answer 2] 
Optimize approach : An integer have 32 bit. We have 26 small letter character.  We just need to allocate each bit for position of a character. If an element is present set the concurrent bit and  finally count the number of set bit.  
(Comment from Tamim: Before trying this approach communicate with the interviewer to make sure about the characters present in the string ie only a-z is present and nothing else)
